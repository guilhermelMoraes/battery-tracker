# battery-tracker
The goal is to develop an Android service that will run continuosly and get information from my cellphone battery in real time. At the moment of writing this README, I have zero knowledge in Kotlin and Android/mobile development in general.

## What battery information will be collected?
 - Battery percentage (e.g: 67%)
 - Charging status (chargin, discharging, or full)

That's it for now. Eventually, it will be updated with more features.
